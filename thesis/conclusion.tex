\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this project has explored the crucial concepts of eBPF-based security. Through a review of the state of the art, it was made clear that although several tools leverage eBPF for security purposes, none of those have gone through the process of formal verification. 

The proposed solution is to develop an eBPF based tool, and submit it to the process of rigorous testing and formal verification, as to guarantee the safety and correctness of said tool. The experiment presented is to be seen as a first step in achieving this goal. 

The document also outlined the main contributions, goals, and objectives for future work. 
The next phase of the project will focus on the completion and testing of the target eBPF application, the formal verification process of it, leaving open the possibility of additional features and targets to be presented along the way. The aim is to advance the state of the art in the security field, specifically on data exfiltration prevention.
