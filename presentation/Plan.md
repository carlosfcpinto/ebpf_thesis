Present eBPF, its capabilities and the way it can be used for security and monitoring tooling.

## Present eBPF based tooling

Present BPF LSM, as is our objective to interact with this API, for security purposes.

Present Tetragon, as the main thing in the state of the art, what it is used for and how it differs from the purpose of this thesis.

## Present possible choke points during the progress of this thesis

Show we are at a cross between adding the feature to Tetragon or go the formal verification route for what is asked.

## Small demo of wwhat has been done so far, the chmod example should be fun

Show `chmod` working as intended, where it preventes user `test2` from accessing that command.
